# Presentation

üîç Identity card
-----------------

-  Python Version: 3.9, 3.10

-  Hardware : CPU / GPU
-  Engineering activities : Data Engineer, ML-Algorithm Engineer
-  Functional set : Robustness, Operation, Evaluation


## General presentation
Neuralde is a python library made to improve the robustness of your models at test time. It proposes a set of methods 
that will allow you to remove identified corruptions in your data before you send it to your model. 
This library addresses issues such as meteorological corruptions, distribution shifts etc.

All methods provided by the library are associated with examples based on open sourced images. 
You can refer to each jupyter notebook for specifics.
These notebooks are linked directly in the technical documentation.

This library can be used in two ways:
- Call it as a main executable to direct process a batch of input images. 
- Import the lib within your python code for an explicit call of included transformations functions 

## I/O description
The executable version of the component take as input :
- A single image or a folder containing all images to process
- A yaml configuration file describing the sequence of transformations you want to apply on your input images

As return as output

- The processed single image or a folder containing all processed images from your input folder

This can be summed-up by the schema below

![Drag Racing](_static/schema.png)

The executable version can be run directly by installing the python library or by running the dockerized version.
We describe in the following the process in two cases.

# Getting started 

## Set up a clean virtual environnement
Tested python versions : [3.9.18, 3.10.16]

Linux setting:

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Windows setting:

```
pip install virtual env 
virtualenv myenv 
.\myenv\Scripts\activate
```

## Install the library (restricted access)

You can install it by a direct downloading from PyPi using the command 

````
pip install neuralde
````

You can install it from it github sources by launching the following command
````
pip install git+https://github.com/IRT-SystemX/neuralde
````
If you got the source code as a zip file, you can install the library from the root directory of the archive by typing : 
```
pip install .
```


## Use the executable

The neural_de executable has 4 parameters : 

- **input_source_path** : This a required arg representing the path to the input source to process. If path represent a single file path. The single file will be \
             processed. If the input source path represents a directory, all images present in directory will be processed. Warning : In that case, all images shall have the same resolution as
             some method requires this constraint and will raise an error if they don't.

- **output_target_path** : Output path where results are stored. If input path is a file, this path represents the output file, \
            else this is the path to oupput direcotry"

- **pipeline_file_path** : Yaml Pipeline Configuration file to use. 

- **output_prefix** : (optional) 0utput_prefix to add to output image filenames in target directory. By default,original names are kept.

For example, with this command:

```
neural_de --input_source_path test_image/test_snow.png  --output_target_path /pipeline_result/snow_processed.png --pipeline_file_path=user_conf_1.yaml 
```

The image ```test_snow.png``` in folder ``` test_image```  is processed through the transformation pipeline defined in ``` user_conf_1.yaml ``` and the results image is stored as a file named ```snow_processed.png```
in ```pipeline_results``` directory

With this command

``` 
neural_de --input_source_path test_images/snow_test  --output_target_path pipeline_res/snow/snow_pipeline_res --output_prefix "transformed_"    --pipeline_file_path=conf_test_1.yaml 
``` 

All images present in subfolder ``` test_images/snow_test```  are processed through the transformation pipeline defined in ``` user_conf_1.yaml ``` and all results images are stored in directory  ``` pipeline_res/snow/snow_pipeline_res``` 
with their name preceded of prefix "transformed_"

## Use the docker version

You can build manually the image from the source, by cloning the source repository from this url https://github.com/IRT-SystemX/neuralde.
Then,  from cloned repository source directory type in a terminal :

```
docker build . -f dockerfile -t irtsystemx/neuralde:1.1.0
```

Or you can direct download the docker image neuralde from dockerhub by typing : 

```
docker pull irtsystemx/neuralde:1.1.0
``` 

The docker pass the input args of neural_de executable through environnement variables.
The only difference is that corresponding source and target dir shall be mounted in the container sotrage to be acessible
forlder ```tmp/in``` and ```tmp/out``` and ```/tmp``` folder are used to store source_dir and target_dir and pipeline_config_file in container.

Thus, to process a directory as source input use the following command

```
docker run -e INPUT_SOURCE_PATH=your_dir -e OUTPUT_TARGET_PATH=your_target_dir -e PIPELINE_PATH=path_to_your_config_  -v your_=target_dir:/tmp/in/your_target_dir -v your_config_file:/tmp/your_config_file irtsystemx/neuralde:1.1.0
```

For example, if your images to process are in a subfolder named ```test_images/snow_test``` your config file is at path ```conf_test_1.yaml``` and you want that processed images
to be in output folder ```docker_res2/snow_test```, you will launch the following command :

```
docker run -e INPUT_SOURCE_PATH="test_images/snow_test" -e OUTPUT_TARGET_PATH="docker_res" -e PIPELINE_FILE_PATH="conf_test_1.yaml" -v  ${PWD}/conf_test_1.yaml:/tmp/conf_test_1.yaml -v ${PWD}/test_images/snow_test:/tmp/in/test_images/snow_test -v ${PWD}/docker_res_2/snow_test:/tmp/out/docker_res/ irtsystemx/neuralde:1.1.0
```
For example, if your images to process are in a subfolder named ```test_images/snow_test``` and your config file is at path ```conf_test_1.yaml``` and you want that processed images
to be in output folder ```docker_res2/snow_test```, you will launch the following command :

```
docker run -e INPUT_SOURCE_PATH="test_images/test_snow.webp" -e OUTPUT_TARGET_PATH="docker_res/res.png" -e PIPELINE_FILE_PATH="conf_test_1.yaml" -v  ${PWD}/conf_test_1.yaml:/tmp/conf_test_1.yaml -v ${PWD}/test_images/test_snow.webp:/tmp/in/test_images/test_snow.webp -v ${PWD}/docker_res_2/:/tmp/out/docker_res/ irtsystemx/neuralde:1.1.0
```

# Define your configuration pipeline

A pipeline configuraiton file is a yaml file containing the list of transformation method to call
and for each of them eventually the name of user parameters to overload:

Here is below an example of such yaml file:
```
- name: CenteredZoom
  init_param:
    keep_ratio: 0.4
- name: DeSnowEnhancer
  init_param:
    device: 'cpu'
- name: KernelDeblurringEnhancer
  init_param:
    kernel: "medium"
- name: ResolutionEnhancer
  init_param:
    device: 'cpu'
  transform:
    target_shape: [800, 800]
    crop_ratio: .3
```    
The defined pipeline apply sequentially on input images the four tranformations
CenteredZoom, DeSnowEnhancer, KernelDeblurringEnhancer and ResolutionEnhancer.
Each transformation has its own parameters.
To see in details the parameters of available transformations see the section **Technical docs**.

# Additional informations 
Neuralde is an **Image2Image library**, thus it is made to process **images batches**. 
It is composed of a list of classes called "enhancers". Each enhancer will have specific options that 
will be defined by the user at object initialisation. 

The process is simple: import the required classes from the library in your code and pass them their specific 
configurations using the parameters on initialisation. 

All the methods using computationally-expensive models (based on different kinds of neural networks
architectures, mostly CNN or transformer-based architectures) can be run on GPU.
To do so, set the parameter device="cuda" at class instantiation.
The concerned which can be run on GPU are:
- NightImageEnhancer
- DesnowEnhancer
- DerainEnhancer
- ResolutionEnhancer
- DiffusionEnhancer
